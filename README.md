# follow-along-navigation

**This project uses ES6, so it only works in Chrome.**
To make it work in most browsers you need to change arrow functions into ES5 functions or transpile the code with something like Webpack or Gulp.

This navigation is sticky and uses javascript give the sense of a follow me effect as you hover over the navigation links.
